# Objective-C KVO and Weak References: A Subtle Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle but critical bug related to Key-Value Observing (KVO) and weak references in Objective-C.  When a weakly referenced object is deallocated while still being observed, a delayed crash or data corruption can occur, making debugging challenging.

## The Problem
The issue stems from the fact that KVO doesn't inherently handle the case where the observed object is deallocated while the observer is still registered.  This can lead to attempts to send updates to a freed memory location, resulting in unpredictable behavior.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone this repository.
2. Build and run the project.
3. Observe the delayed crash or unexpected behavior.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully managing the KVO observation lifecycle.  Specifically, ensuring that `removeObserver` is called when the observation is no longer needed, even in scenarios where the observed object might be deallocated.

## Mitigation Strategies
* Use strong references cautiously with KVO.
* Implement robust error handling to catch potential exceptions.
* Thoroughly test KVO interactions in your code, particularly those involving weak references.
