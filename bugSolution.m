To fix this, we need to ensure that `removeObserver:` is called whenever the observed object is no longer needed.  This is crucial, even if the object has already been deallocated. The system won't crash when calling `removeObserver:` on a deallocated object.

Here's a revised implementation:
```objectivec
@interface MyObject : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) MyOtherObject *otherObject;
@end

@implementation MyObject
- (void)observeValueForKeyPath:(NSString *)keyPath ofObject:(id)object change:(NSDictionary *)change context:(void *)context {
    if (object == nil) return; //Added check for nil object
    // ... observation logic ...
}

- (void)dealloc {
    if (self.otherObject) {
        [self.otherObject removeObserver:self forKeyPath:@
